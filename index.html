        <h2>What’s the origin of Science Hack Day?</h2>
        
        <p>
        In 2010, Ariel Waldman was frustrated that there was a lot of science 
        data being made open, but that no one was doing anything interesting 
        with it. She put together a panel at SXSW that year to share her 
        frustration with others. Jeremy Keith was sitting in the audience and 
        became so inspired by this problem that he organized the first Science 
        Hack Day later that year in London. Encouraged by what Jeremy had 
        started, Ariel took the torch to make Science Hack Day a global 
        phenomenon. She re-created the event in San Francisco, and published 
        open instructions that anyone could adopt. Ariel continues to instigate 
        events across the globe, supporting people in creating a Science Hack Day 
        in their own city. The torch is now carried by the dozens of organizers of 
        Science Hack Day worldwide who have made it what it is today. Come join us 
        for the first Twin Cities Science Hack Day!
